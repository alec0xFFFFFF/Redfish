# Redfish
Redfish serves to identify and measure your catch, so you know if you can take it home or if it is out of season, protected, or just an unusual species!

# Running
Open Redfish.xcworkspace, change the bundle identifier to an identifier linked to your Apple developer account in order to run. Build using the Redfish scheme.
